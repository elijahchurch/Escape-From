#  Escape From The Strange Castle

#### By: Jason Elijah Church

#### Brief Description
A Choose-Your-Own Adventure application made in React. 

## Technologies Used

* React
* HTML
* TypeScript
* Markdown
* CSS
* Git Bash
* Visual Code Studio
* Node Package Manager
* Jest
* Babel


## Feature Description:

Coming soon!!


## Setup/ Installation Requirements

* NOTE: The story is still not all the way written so if you arriving to this repo at this time, I would wait a week or so for me to finish writing the complete demo before cloning it down and testing it out yourself (also see Known Bugs section for further details on issues if you try to run it right now.)

* Clone this repository to your desktop.
* In the topmost directory of the project, open up all of the code using Visual Code Studio or a similar application to view the written code.
* If you have Node Package Manager installed on your computer and are running v16.13.1, you can enter npm install in the topmost directory of the project to install all the listed plug-ins in the package.json.
* From there the webpage itself can be viewed by entering npm start in your console to open up a local live server.

## Known Bugs

* MAIN BUG: Story options that lead to pages that have not been written yet will crash the application, as it is asking React to set state to data that doesn't exist yet. Give me time to write the whole demo, and this won't be an issue! The plan is to have a "Thank You for Playing" page display once you reach the end of a story path.

* I haven't done a full deep dive of the JSON data to check for any typos, so bugs may occur if there are typos with IDs. Also, want to make sure there are no typos with the story text itself!
